**A 3D animated constellation representing a papillote** (french candy name),\
adapted from [ladunjexa/reactjs18-3d-portfolio](https://github.com/ladunjexa/reactjs18-3d-portfolio), and designed for a web agency I had named Papillote.

Stars positions were obtained with a customized version of [nicoptere/volume_distribution](https://github.com/nicoptere/volume_distribution),\
raycasting from random points on faces of a virtual cube surrounding the 3D model.\
49152 32-bit floating point numbers, corresponding to 16384 stars coordinates, are saved in a binary file for size consideration.
